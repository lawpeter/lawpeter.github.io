# I. Introduction:
  Artificial Intelligence has become inevitable in education. It is something both professors and students have been forced to accomodate, as it has become integral to many processes that drive learning today. As a student myself, I typically make use of ChatGPT. I try my best to limit this to purely helping me understand material, but I acknowledge that it has its uses in problem solving and producing valuable work. In addition to ChatGPT, which I use as a conversational co-brainstormer, I've used GitHub Copilot to help me complete some coding assignments. It is the latter that I choose to dive into today.


# II. Personal Experience with AI:
## Experience WODs
  I tried my best to not use AI for the Experience WODs. I did this because I found the value of these came from the trial and error, and I used them to become familiar with new material. In addition to this, the assignments being graded on completion assured me that I didn't need to abuse AI in order to get a better grade. That being said, when other classes began to pick up and I found myself not having the brainpower to work through the assignments, I did lean on ChatGPT or Copilot to help me complete some of the work. For example, for the Tic-Tac-Toe WOD I used Copilot to complete some of the extra assignments by prompting it to write the code required to complete the task and provided it the detailed instructions given on the website.

## In-class Practice WODs
  For both the In-class Practice WODs and the In-class WODs, I found that the time frame was too fast to *not* use AI on the assignments. Even though I found myself not understanding what I was submitting, I felt it was necessary to use AI to complete the assignments. This feeling was compounded by the fact that missing a miniscule portion of the assignment would result in a 10%; I was willing to sacrifice my understanding for the grade.

## In-class WODs
  (see previous section). For an example on how I used ChatGPT and Copilot in parallel to complete the assignments, I would prompt Copilot with the entire instructions copy/pasted into the prompt and ask it to write the code for me. Since Copilot takes longer to produce results, I would spend my time waiting giving ChatGPT more of a detailed overview of what I wanted in preparation to fix the issues.
  I tended to use Copilot for larger coding jobs, and ChatGPT for more direct, smaller issue resolution.

## Essays
  I did not use AI on my Essays, barring one. I did this because I found it wasn't necessary, as I am typically able to get an essay completed without much unnecessary stress. Additionally, I do not like the 'voice' that AI's impart on written works. The one essay I did use AI on was one where I found myself swamped with other work and the deadline was approaching. I asked ChatGPT to give me an outline and rough draft based on previous work, and then re-wrote some of the parts I found necessary to rework.

## Final project
  For the final project, I did use Copilot to help me with some of the issues that I didn't feel the need to work through too thorougly myself. For example, I asked Copilot to help me write some database functions to add users. I found myself asking Copilot this because it is fairly repetetive code, and the AI would be able to output a rough draft quicker than I could type through it.

## Learning a concept / tutorial
  This is the largest section that I use AI on. I find myself asking AI for a high-level overview of a concept, or to provide me with an example so I can think through it myself. That being said, I didn't do much of this in ICS314, so I don't have exact prompts I can use as examples.

## Answering a question in class or in Discord
  I didn't find myself using AI to answer questions. Part of this was because I didn't answer many questions in Discord. The other part (for in class questions) was that I find myself able to answer the questions off the top of my head quicker than I would be able to write a successful prompt and parse through the response.

## Asking or answering a smart-question
  Similar to the previous section, I pride myself in my ability to ask smart questions. It is for this reason that I didn't use AI when asking smart questions, as I find that I can typically come up with a more accurate question that represents my true inquiry than I could by explaining the issue to an LLM.

## Coding example
  This ties in with the 'Learning a concept / tutorial' section. I use AI to give me an example to understand use-cases as a part of the learning process, but I don't often just ask for Coding examples.

## Explaining code
  I don't ask AI to explain code because I believe that learning to parse through dense code that might be hard to understand builds invaluable problem-solving and critical thinking skills. 

## Writing code
  Any code-writing that I use AI for I have already mentioned. From past experiences, I find that when I use AI to write code I am not thorough enough in understanding what it writes, so I try to avoid using it for that unless I believe I could successfully write the code myself and AI could just do it faster, or I don't feel the need to understand what it's outputting.

## Documenting code
  When it comes to documenting code, I find that ChatGPT or Copilot don't often provide me with the documentation that I need. Whether the comments are more verbose than I was intending, or it doesn't properly understand the intention behind what was written, I often find that personal documentation provides more value than using AI does.

## Quality assurance
  I will ask AI to do some light 'QA' testing for me. For example, on the Weather WODs, I asked AI to provide me plenty of test cases that would cover all of the bases. That being said, AI often messed up the numbers or bounds, so I found myself going back in to correct the mistakes. In my experience, AI is good for the scaffolding and ideation of those edge cases, but not often effective at testing implementation.

## Other uses in ICS 314 not listed
  I didn't find any other use cases within ICS314 that are not listed.


# III. Impact on Learning and Understanding:
  In ICS314 specifically, AI has been beneficial to my grade but detrimental to my learning. Sure, I know a high-level overview of how concepts fit together, but due to the nature of many of the assignments I left the 'practice' work to an LLM agent and I let it do its thing. This resulted in me getting the work done efficiently, but not understanding the material I was producing and the content of the course.


# IV. Practical Applications:
  For me personally, I have used AI as a key player in my learning process throughout college. Being able to simulate a conversation with someone who knows more about a topic than I do allows me to ask smart questions and grow my understanding. In addition to this, I have used it in some personal coding projects for productive ideation. That being said, when I start using AI on personal projects outside of ideation, I quickly fall into a pit of letting the AI create and solve it's own issues, and stepping back. I'm trying to dial back the amount I use LLMs in this manner for that reason.


# V. Challenges and Opportunities:
  The largest challenge I have with AI is one that I've mentioned many times previously. The issue of not understanding what code the AI is producing but trusting it regardless is a slippery slope. As for opportunities, I believe AI can be widely used to make workers more productive and efficient, as it can take away much of the busywork.


# VI. Comparative Analysis:
  I believe that in no way, shape, or form does AI-enhanced teaching outperform traditional learning. I think as a student working on improving and understanding material it can be powerful when office hours aren't available or informative, but I think it holds no value inside the classroom. In terms of all three: engagement, knowledge retention, and practical skill development, I believe traditional teaching beats out AI-enchanced teaching 10 times out of 10. The only time I can imagine it being beneficial is a class that is specifically aimed at improving effectiveness using LLMs. In all other scenarios, I believe that a student will learn better, understand information more in-depth, and have better long-term skills if taught without AI.


# VII. Future Considerations:
  I don't think AI belongs in education. As mentioned previously, I don't think it has a place in the classroom. I believe there is room for growth, as I believe many universities should begin offering courses on how to reliably use AI to benefit learning, but replace it. Other than that, I believe AI will be nothing but a road-block for true learning among students.


# VIII. Conclusion:
  While I don't have exact prompts that I used throughout the class, as you've seen throughout this writing there are many things that I used AI on in this class. I believe I might've used it too much, and sacrificed some of my understanding. That being said, I believe that that is part of the learning process, and I will strengthen my self-control and prompting skills with more use. Since my use of AI was detrimental to my learning, and I have heard similar stories from many other students, I think AI should not be integrated in future courses.
