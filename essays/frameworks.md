## Foreword
This essay will be structured very similarly to the Standardization essay.

## Initial Thoughts
I knew working with frameworks would make my life easier. This is because that's their whole purpose. They are intended to assist in streamlining web development and make the process smoother. This is especially useful for me, as I am someone who has no experience with front-end development, and don't have the ability to do the customization myself using pure CSS. This makes it easy to implement functions that I wouldn't be able to do myself, such as a carousel. Below is an image of a webpage I recreated using Bootstrap as the framework for a project.

## Conflicts
I haven't experienced any major conflicts with frameworks... yet. I say yet because I imagine that as I improve my development capabilities, frameworks themselves won't cut it. That being said, I don't expect this being a major problem. From what I've experienced so far, frameworks are complementary, or additive, to the built-in customization. If a framework doesn't have something I'd want, or implements it in a way I do not like, I can simply make the desired changes myself. That is why I believe that frameworks will help me improve web development efficiency any time I use them.

## Efficiency
Speaking of efficiency, frameworks aren't the only thing that boost productivity. I am comfortable using generative AI in my web development project because at my level there isn't much room for detrimental errors or catastrophic failures. Most of my experience with web dev have been annoyances getting things to look exactly how I like, yet I know the tools are simple enough to use. It is for this reason that I believe generative AI increases my productivity tenfold. It doesn't need to understand complicated functions or tough algorithmic logic, it can just help me put the pretty boxes in the square hole! One example of this was a recent WOD I did for my ICS314 class, where I was able to get the entire assignment done using just code generated by ChatGPT.

## Final Remarks
I'm glad that I am learning web development in the age of GenAI. I have never been a very creative person, but I do appreciate proper organization and structure. This is why I don't mind the design process of frontend development, but I appreciate that I can use AI models to improve my workflow and add ideas that I can incorporate. Altogether, I'm excited about what I can learn from the process going forward.
