# Introduction
  ICS314 at UHM has been a course that has contributed significantly to my understanding of development and confidence when pursuing future projects/opportunities. It has taught me a number of things, as well as strengthened many of the skills I already possessed. Two of the skills I feel are most important going forward beyond just an academic course are Open Source Programming and effective Coding Standards. They were an integral part of the code I produced during the course, and will shape my thought processes when working outside of classes.

# Open Source Programming
  Open Source Programming is a concept that I always knew existed, but never had a great idea of what it truly was. Open Source Programming is the idea that any and all code in a codebase is viewable to everyone who wants to access it. In addition to this, anyone can modify and recreate the code. The only limits are when it comes to monetization of the code. In my mind, it goes hand-in-hand with effective version control. Most often, open source projects are located on the popular platfor GitHub (see the image at the beginning of this work). GitHub is, as it sounds, a hub for git. Git is a tool that is used to control the versions of varying codebases. This is important for open source programming, because often times codebases will have many people across the world working independently on bug fixes and feature implementation. This requires a strong organization and documentation process that enables others to quickly understand and implement the code. It is this final point that I find the most useful outside of the course. Being able to document work and, in turn, implement extensive traceability is something that impacts my life in other projects and settings. This works in parallel to strong coding standards.

# Coding Standards
  Coding Standards is something that was included extensively throughout ICS314. As a basis, we used ESLint to check our code for errors. This was the most effective 'rule' we used. At its core, coding standards is exactly what it sounds like. They can be a set of rules, whether spoken or unspoken, which help to guide development. This has been useful to me, as it helps to structure a body of work or code. These are useful in group projects as well as in solo or personal projects. In group projects, standards can keep everyone on the same page and make it easier to comprehend other's code. In personal projects, it keeps development from getting too messy or out of hand.

# Conclusion
  Together, both Open Source Programming and Coding Standards are integral to modern-day development and software engineering. While neither of them are topics that are incredibly hard to understand on their own, or impossible to learn independently, having a course to work through and projects to implement them make it infinitely easier to understand their uses and benefits at a foundational level. Additionally, ICS314 taught me many other skills and tools besides these two that I will be able to take beyond the course and implement in my daily life.
