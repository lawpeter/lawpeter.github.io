## Foreword
This essay explores how recurring solutions shape both the world and my final project, using metaphor to reveal the subtle power of design patterns.

## A Familiar Feeling
Why do some systems feel intuitive while others feel chaotic? Before I ever wrote a line of code, I understood this from baking recipes, LEGO building instructions, and listening to music. There is a comfort in structure, a sense of “I’ve seen this before,” even if the pieces are different.  

Patterns, sometimes invisible but always dependable, help things work.

## Patterns in Everyday Life
If a friend were to ask me to help assemble a shelf, we wouldn't invent a new method. We would follow a familiar rhythm: legs, braces, screws, level. Recipes work the same way, as do LEGO sets, Ikea furniture, and choruses in popular songs.  

None of these are rigid instructions. Instead, they are reusable strategies for achieving a successful result.

These strategies are not accidents. They exist because people encountered the same problems again and again — and found solutions worth repeating. This wouldn't be possible without documentation and collaboration. There's a reason Pantone is so successful at standardizing colors. They have patterns that they follow, and this allows them to maintain a structured selection of reliable options.

## Discovering the Parallel in Programming
Once I began writing software, I realized the same kind of strategies existed in code. They were called design patterns, but they felt familiar. They were not snippets to be copied and pasted. They were ways of thinking.  

Patterns help developers solve recurring problems: coordinating objects, controlling access to shared resources, and simplifying complexity. They make code more readable, more maintainable, and more collaborative. They also help when problem solving, not just when writing code. In my ICS311 Algorithms class, there are patterns to the way greedy algorithms or dynamic programming solutions are constructed.

Like a good recipe, they make success easier to repeat.

## Enter the Final Project
Our ICS314 final project wasn’t simply about building features. It needed to be organized, reliable, and maintainable. Components had to communicate. Shared data needed a single source of truth. Interfaces needed to remain clean even as complexity increased.

This is where patterns stopped being theory and started becoming essential. This is especially significant as we started using AI throughout our codebase. AI is pretty good at rough structure, but doesn't always fit into what you expect or need. For example, this essay's structure, format, and text was initially generated by ChatGPT. That being said, it didn't do exactly what I had expected or hoped. It successfully completed the monotonous task of structuring the work, but I still had to go back in and make the changes I needed.

## Patterns at Work
We used several patterns repeatedly. Two examples of those patterns are:

- Structured Issue Generation
While working together, we had to find a way to structure our work and evenly distribute it amongst each other. This is where we leant on patterns in the way we structured our Issues. Not only were we following the IDPM guidelines, but we were getting in a habit.

- Talking Through Eachothers Work
This isn't to say we talked over eachother or were shouting. All we needed to do was ensure every time we made a change independently, we were able to talk through our solution and justify it to our teammates. This pattern of communicatin helps us succeed efficiently and effectively.

Each pattern emerged from a need. None were used because a book said so, they were used because the problems were real.

- Looking Back
The more I explicitly worked with patterns, the more I saw them everywhere. Not as rigid instructions, but as guidance. They helped our team communicate, prevented confusion, and allowed us to add features without fear of collapse. In addition to this, I slowly realized how similar patterns were to habits. The types of habits you build after baking various treats, or building many LEGO sets. You begin to get into your own rhythm that helps you succeed.

Design patterns became quiet helpers.

## Final Remarks
If an interviewer asks me what design patterns are, I won’t begin with definitions. I will talk about blueprints, recipes, and chord progressions. Patterns are reusable strategies for recurring problems.

And when they ask which patterns I’ve used, I can confidently describe the ones that shaped our final project — the invisible structures that made everything work a little more smoothly.
